  A crop is a plant that can be grown and harvested extensively for profit or subsistence.
  [1] When the plants of the same kind are cultivated at one place on a large scale, it is called a crop.
  Most crops are cultivated in agriculture or aquaculture. Crops may include macroscopic fungus
  (e.g. mushrooms) and marine macroalga (e.g. seaweed).
